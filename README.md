Tools and supplies to make a simple book

 * Needle with eye same size as the shank, size 14 to 18 range. Can use a blunt needle too.
 * sponge
 * utility knife: Good options: with blade snapping tool, blade lock, onboard storage for extra blades.
 * steel rule: etched markings, scale should reach end of ruler
 * "folder" made of bone or teflon or medium hardness wood (maybe nylon?)Maybe make your own from a paint stick, add a finish like beeswax or linseed oil.
 * "awl" - a puncture tool
 * Paper in the 70 to 90 GSM range
 * "Long Grain" means the grain is parallel to the long edge of the paper 
 * "Short Grain" means the grain is parallel to the short edge of the paper
 * Keep grain aligned with spine of book to keep pages from curling along spine when wet with glue
 * The side that gets water applied, expands and forces the paper to curl under.
 * Most standard copy paper is long grain which means that when wet, the paper will curl 
 * linen thread
 * beeswax or parafin wax (any candle)
 * Cardstock or cover stock paper for book cover in the 150 to 250 GSM range
